    "The sixth center was organized by Dr. Ivan Frantz, and its study was known as the Minnesota Coronary Experiment. Dr. Frantz was a strong proponent of reducing saturated fats to prevent death from heart disease. He believed so strongly in the idea that he placed his household on a strict diet very low in saturated fats. The main difference between the Minnesota Coronary Experiment and the rest of the National Diet-Heart Study was the setting. While the other centers in the study looked at volunteers, Dr. Frantz conducted his study at Faribault State Hospital, which housed patients who were institutionalized due to disabilities or mental illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this institution, the subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups: half of the subjects, the **control group**, were fed meals cooked with saturated fats, and the other half, the **diet group**, were fed meals cooked with polyunsaturated fats. For example, the diet group's oils were replaced with corn oils and their butter was replaced with margarine. The subjects did not know which food they were getting, to avoid any potential bias or placebo effect. This type of study is known as a **blind** study.\n",
    "\n",

Prior to beginning the diet phase, the project was explained and sample foods were served. Residents were given the opportunity to decline participation.\"*\n",

    "Despite the level of detail and effort in the study, the results of the study were never extensively examined until the late 20th century. Over 40 years after the data were collected, Dr. Christopher Ramsden heard about the experiment, and asked Dr. Frantz's son Robert to uncover the files in the Frantz family home's dusty basement. You can learn more about the story of how the data was recovered on the [Revisionist History podcast](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/20-the-basement-tapes) or in [Scientific American magazine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/records-found-in-dusty-basement-undermine-decades-of-dietary-advice/)."
