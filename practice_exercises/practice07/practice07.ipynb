    "At the YData Annual Carnival Ring Toss game, you are given 100 rings per game. You will win the grand prize of a life-size YData Bear if 60 rings out of 100 land on the bottles. As you may have guessed, carnival owners purposely make the probability of winning very small and sometimes, it is nearly impossible to win the cute life-size YData Bear. Suppose for each ring, the probability of you landing the ring perfectly on the bottle is $.5$. How likely are you to win the grand prize?\n",

In mathematical form, the Chebyshev's Inequality can be expressed as:\n",

    "1. Write a function called `chebyshev_bound`.  It should take 1 argument which is the number of standard deviations away from the average, or `zSDs`. (For example, if our observed value is 10 standard deviations away from the average value, `zSDs` = 10.) It should return the maximum proportion of values greater than or equal to zSDs standard deviations away from the average given by the Chebyshev's Inequality.

    "As for your reference, the actual probability of you landing 60 or more rings on the bottle is $ \\binom{100}{60} .5^{60} * .5^{100-60}$ which is about $0.01$. It is important to note that Chebychev's Inequailty gives an upper bound, not an exact value or an approximation. What makes the result powerful is that it is true for all lists – all distributions, no matter how irregular. As we saw, the probability of winning in the range \"average $+2$ SDs\" under the simulations is quite a bit lower than the upper bound given by the Chebychev's Inequality. "
