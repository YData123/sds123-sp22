The only **\"work\"** on this homework is to run all the cells in this notebook. If you have a working Python environment with the `datascinece` package installed, you should not see any error messages as you run the cells below. If you do encounter error messages, please try to debug by going to office hours and asking on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/18969/discussion/).\n","\n","Instructions for how to install an Anaconda environment with the class packages on your own computer [can be found here](https://ydata123.org/sp22/setup.html). You can also run Jupyter notebooks using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) which might be the easiest option. \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Gkzwp2PvUpRb"},"source":["**Deadline:**\n","\n","This assignment will not be turned in. However, you should try to complete it before Wednesday February 2nd to make sure that you have everything working in advance of working on the first homework. \n","\n","If you run into technical difficulties, the drop-in office hours schedule can be found on [Canvas](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/76050).
