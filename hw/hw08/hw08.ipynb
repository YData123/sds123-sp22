    "Submit your assignment as a .pdf on Gradescope. You can access Gradescope through Canvas on the left-side of the class home page. The problems in each homework assignment are numbered. When submitting on Gradescope, please select the correct pages of your pdf that correspond to each problem. Failure to mark pages correctly will result in points being deducted from your homework score.\n",

    "**Note**: Please carefully read over all your answers in the .pdf document you create prior to uploading it to Gradescope to make sure all your answers are readable and are not cutoff. Points will be taken off for any answer that can not be read, and it will not be possible to resubmit homework answers. Adding extra space and new lines can help prevent answers from being cut off, and if you run into problems please post questions to Ed Discussions or come to office hours for help. \n"
